Game|Push|GameDescription
GameDescription|Display|Well, it's kind of a moving target.
|Display|The rules and objectives keep changing...
|Display|...to say nothing of the bugs.
|Display|But basically, use the arrow keys to move.
|Display|If you move over the exit there...
|Display|...and press E, you'll go outside.
|Display|After that, uh, have adventures, I guess.
|Option|How do I win?|Game.Win
|Option|What buttons do I press?|Game.Controls
|Option|Any exciting gameplay mechanics?|Game.Mechanics
Game.GoWithMe.Option|Option|Will you go with me, to help?|Game.GoWithMe
|Option|Got any general tips?|Game.Tips
|Option|I never read the instructions!|Game.NeverMind
Game.Prompt|Prompt
Game.Win|Display|Last I heard?
|Display|Get five keys, touch the goal.
|Display|Whee.
|Display|Oh, and since the latest updates...
|Display|...you'll have to FIND the goal first.
|Goto||Game.Prompt
Game.Controls|Display|The arrow keys move you around.
|Display|The G key picks up any nearby items.
|Display|The E key interacts with things and people.
|Display|The F key uses a weapon, if one's equipped.
|Display|Tab or Escape brings up the menu.
|Display|Space jumps, if you've learned how.
|Display|There's SUPPOSED to be gamepad support...
|Display|...but it never gets tested.
|Goto||Game.Prompt
Game.Mechanics|Display|Not really.
|Display|You can pick stuff up.
|Display|You can then see what you've picked up...
|Display|...by going to the status screen...
|Display|...by pressing, I think, Tab?
|Display|You can also equip things from there.
|Display|If you can find and equip a gun and ammo...
|Display|...you can shoot the red guys...
|Display|...but they'll just keep coming forever.
|Display|The status screen also has a 'craft' tab...
|Display|...though there aren't many recipes yet.
|Display|For now I think you can upgrade armor.
|Display|Finally, there's a tab for skills...
|Display|...like jumping and running...
|Display|...which are available to learn...
|Display|...provided you already know the prereqs...
|Display|...and have enough experience.
|Display|You gain experience by killing 'monsters'...
|Display|...that makes YOU the real monster, though.
|Goto||Game.Prompt
Game.GoWithMe|Display|No, I'm pretty comfortable here.
|Display|But I'll give you a walkie-talkie...
|Display|...so I can provide valuable insights.
|Script|(u) => { u.world.placeCurrent.player().itemHolder().itemEntityAdd( new Entity(null, [ new Item("Walkie-Talkie", 1) ] ) ); }

|Goto||Game.Prompt
Game.NeverMind|Display|You were fun.  I'll miss you.
|Pop||Subject
Trade|Display|I guess so.  Got anything good?
