Game Stub
=========

This repository implements the stub of a game in TypeScript
using the This Could Be Better Game Framework.
See /Documentation/Creating_a_New_Game_from_Stubs.md for instructions.
This file should be heavily edited to reflect the details of the new game.  


Building
--------

To build the game, make sure the "tsc" command is installed,
then run the _Build.bat or .sh script, depending on operating system,
from within the Source/_Scripts directory.


Running
-------

To run the game, open the .html file in the Source directory in
a web browser that runs JavaScript.  When running locally, it may be necessary
to start the web browser with some security features disabled: a script is
provided for this in the /Source/_Scripts/ directory.


Screenshots
-----------
