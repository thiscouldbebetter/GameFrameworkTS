This Could Be Better Game Framework Development Guide
=====================================================

This guide illustrates the creation of a new game from scratch using the This Could Be Better Game Framework.


1. Setting Up a New Game from Stubs
-----------------------------------

1.1. Make sure that TypeScript and the Google Chrome or Chromum browser are installed on the computer.  Opening a command prompt and run the commands "tsc" and "chrome" from within it, verifying that the commands are recognized.

1.2. In any convenient location, download a copy of the GameFrameworkTS repository by opening a command prompt and running this command:

	git clone https://github.com/thiscouldbebetter/GameFrameworkTS

1.3. Then, within the directory for the newly downloaded repository, locate the "Stub" directory.

1.4. Copy the Stub directory to any convenient location outside of the original GameFrameworkTS repository's directory.

1.5. From within the newly copied Stub directory, run the following command to run a script that converts the directory into Git repository and add the framework as a submodule (if running on a Windows machine, run the ".bat" script instead):

	./Setup-Git-Init\_Repo\_and\_Add\_Framework\_Submodule.sh

1.6. Delete the file "./Setup-Git-Init_Repo_and_Add_Framework_Submodule.sh" and its .bat equivalent, as they will no longer be needed.

1.7. In the Stub directory, open the Source directory.

1.8. From the Source directory, open a command prompt, then run the command "_Build.sh" (or "_Build.bat" for Windows) to compile the program.  Wait for the command to complete, then verify that no errors are displayed and that a .js file is generated for each of the .ts files in the Source directory.  If there are errors, make sure that TypeScript is installed, and that the output of the "date" command has the format expected by the script.

1.9. Close any open instances of the Chrome or Chromium browser.

1.10. In the Source directory, locate the script named "RunChromeWithFileAccess.sh" (or the .bat equivalent if running Windows) and run it.  This will start the web browser with the necessary permissions for running the game locally without a dedicated web server.

1.11. Open Game.html in the web browser.  Press the Enter key a few times to progress past the default opening screens showing placeholder screens for the game's framework, producer, and title.  Then, when prompted to create or choose a profile, click the Skip button.  After that, a blank screen is displayed.  You can press Escape to see the menu, but there's nothing more to the game yet.

2. Creating the Ground
----------------------

2.1. That blank void is pretty boring.  Let's lay the foundation of our game, literally, by adding some ground.

2.2. First, we'll add a class to represent it.  But before that, we'll need somewhere to put that class file.  Within the Source directory, create a new directory named "Model".

2.3. Within the newly created Model directory, create a new file named "Planet.ts", containing the text below:

	class Planet extends Entity
	{
		constructor(name: string, size: Coords, horizonHeight: number)
		{
			super
			(
				name,
				[
					Drawable.fromVisual
					(
						VisualRectangle.fromSizeAndColorFill
						(
							Coords.fromXY(size.x, horizonHeight),
							Color.Instances().GreenDark
						)
					),

					Locatable.fromPos
					(
						Coords.fromXY(size.x / 2, size.y - horizonHeight / 2)
					),
				]
			);
		}
	}

2.4. The new Planet class is a subclass of Entity, and it has two properties, namely, Drawable and Locatable.  An instance of Drawable represents something that can be drawn to the screen, while an instance of Locatable represents something that has a specific position and orientation (and, incidentally, velocity and acceleration, among other things, as will be discussed later).

2.5. We'll need to add a reference to the newly created Planet class to Game.html.  But be careful: If you add references in the wrong place, it might break your game.  Open Game.html and locate the existing reference to "_Main.js" and add this line above it, with a blank line in between:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="Model/Planet.js"></script>

2.6. Now that we've declared the Planet class and added references to it and to the VisualRectangle class that we need to draw it, we'll add an instance of Planet to PlaceDefault.

2.7. Back in the Source directory, open the file PlaceDefault.ts in a text editor.  Locate the constructor, and within it, the array being passed as the "entities" argument of the super() constructor.  Within that array, locate the existing "new UserInputListener()" element, add a comma after it, add the following text on the line below, then save the file.

	new Planet("Planet0", Coords.fromXY(400, 300), 50)

2.8. From the _Scripts directory, run the command "_Build.sh" or "_Build.bat" to compile the program again.  Wait for the command to complete, and verify that no errors are displayed.

2.9. In the web browser, refresh Game.html and advance through the startup screens to start the game again.  Verify that a green field, representing the ground, appears at the bottom of the screen.

<img src="Screenshot-2-Ground.png" />


3. Adding a Ship for the Player
-------------------------------

3.1. Now there's some ground, but ground by itself is almost as boring as a void.  Let's add a spaceship.  For that, we'll need another class file.

3.2. Back in the Model directory, create a new file name "Ship.ts", containing the text below:

	class Ship extends Entity
	{
		constructor(name: string, pos: Coords)
		{
			super
			(
				name,
				[
					Drawable.fromVisual
					(
						VisualPolygon.fromVerticesAndColorFill
						(
							[
								Coords.fromXY(-5, -5),
								Coords.fromXY(5, 0),
								Coords.fromXY(-5, 5),
							],
							Color.Instances().Gray
						)
					),

					Locatable.fromPos(pos)
				]
			);
		}
	}

3.3. Like the Planet class, the new Ship class is a subclass of Entity, and it has its own instances of the same two property types, namely, Drawable and Locatable.

3.4. Since we've added a new class, we'll need to add a reference to it in Game.html.  Add the following line right below the one recently added for Planet.js, and save:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="Model/Ship.js"></script>

3.5. Now that the Ship class is defined and referenced, let's create an instance of it and add it to the entity collection of our PlaceDefault instance.  Back in the Source directory, open the file PlaceDefault.ts in a text editor again.  Within the array being passed as the "entities" argument of the super() constructor, add the following line, make sure that there are commas between all the array elements, and save the file.

	new Ship("Ship0", Coords.fromXY(100, 100) )

3.6. Compile the program again by running the script named "_Build", then refresh Game.html, start the game, and progress past the startup screens as before.  A gray triangle pointing right, representing a spaceship, now appears above the ground.

<img src="Screenshot-3-Ship-Stationary.png" />

3.7. In the browser's address bar, append the text "?debug=SkipOpening" to the end of the URL for Game.html and press the Enter key to reload.  This will skip the opening scenes to the main part of the game, saving the time and trouble needed to skip past them every time.


4. Making the Ship Move
-----------------------

4.1. Now there's a spaceship, which should be exciting.  But it doesn't move.  So it's still pretty boring for a spaceship.  More of a spaceblimp.  Except even blimps move faster than this.  So let's make it move.

4.2. To make it move, we'll assign it a velocity to go along with its position.  Open Ship.ts in a text editor, replace the line "Locatable.fromPos(pos)" with the following text, and save:

	Locatable.fromDisposition
	(
		Disposition.fromPosAndVel
		(
			Coords.fromXY(100, 100), // pos
			Coords.fromXY(1, 0) // vel
		)
	)

4.3. Run the _Build script again, then refresh Game.html to see the updates.  The same gray, triangular spaceship still appears, but now it moves.  It moves all the way to the right side of the screen, then disappears, never to return.  Bye, little spaceship.  We hardly knew ye.

<img src="Screenshot-4-Ship-Moving.gif" />


5. Making the Ship Wrap Around
------------------------------

5.1. The spaceship is briefly somewhat more interesting than when it was stationary, but once it moves off the right side of the screen, the view is even more boring that it was before.  To fix that, that, we can make the screen "wrap", so that when the spaceship moves off the right side of the screen, it reappears on the left side.  That, in turn, can be accomplished by giving the Ship entity the Constrainable property and putting a Constraint on it.

5.2. Open Ship.ts and, somewhere in the list of properties being passed to the super() constructor, add the following text, making sure to add commas between elements as appropriate:

	Constrainable.fromConstraint
	(
		new Constraint_WrapToPlaceSizeXTrimY()
	)

5.3. Recompile the game by running the _Build script, then refresh the web browser.  Now when the ship leaves the right side of the screen, it reappears on the left, in a repeating cycle.

<img src="Screenshot-5-Ship-Wrapping.gif" />


6. Making the Ship Accelerate Back and Forth
--------------------------------------------

6.1. Now the ship wraps to stay in view continuously, so the view stays interesting.  It would be more interesting still if the ship changed speed and direction.  To make that work, we need to give it the Actor property. 

6.2. To define the ActivityDefn for the ship's behavior, open Ship.ts and add the following method after the constructor:

	static activityDefnDoSpaceshipStuffBuild(): ActivityDefn
	{
		var activityDefnDoSpaceshipStuff = new ActivityDefn
		(
			"DoSpaceshipStuff",
			// perform
			(uwpe: UniverseWorldPlaceEntities) =>
			{
				var place = uwpe.place;
				var entity = uwpe.entity;

				var placeWidthHalf = place.size.x / 2;

				var ship = entity as Ship;
				var shipLoc = ship.locatable().loc;
				var shipPos = shipLoc.pos;
				var shipOrientation = shipLoc.orientation;
				var shipForward = shipOrientation.forward;
				var shipAccel = shipLoc.accel;
				if (shipPos.x > placeWidthHalf)
				{
					shipForward.x = -1;
				}
				else
				{
					shipForward.x = 1;
				}
				shipOrientation.forwardSet(shipForward);

				var accelerationPerTick = 0.1;
				shipAccel.x = shipForward.x * accelerationPerTick;
			}
		);

		return activityDefnDoSpaceshipStuff;
	}

6.3. Now that the ActivityDefn for the Ship is defined, we want to make sure that the WorldDefn knows about it, so that it's there when the Ship entity's Actor property tries to look it up.  Open WorldGame.ts, locate the existing line that starts with "UserInputListener", and add the following line within that same array, making sure that there are commas between all the array elements:

	Ship.activityDefnDoSpaceshipStuffBuild()

6.4. Finally, give the Actor property to the Ship.  In Ship.ts, add a new entry to the array of entity properties, right below the Locatable instance, making sure as always to include a comma between each element in the array:

	Actor.fromActivityDefnName("DoSpaceshipStuff")

6.5. Run the _Build script again, then refresh Game.html in the browser.  The spaceship now accelerates toward the right side of the screen if it's on the left half of the screen, and accelerates toward the left side of the screen if it's on the right side of the screen.

<img src="Screenshot-6-Ship-Accelerating.gif" />

6.6. Furthermore, our spaceship faces to the right when it's accelerating right, and to the left when it's accelerating left.  Ordinarily, we'd need to modify the Visual for the Ship for this to work, but since we're using a VisualPolygon, by default it automatically transforms the visual based on the Ship's orientation.  And we already added the code to set the Ship's orientation, in the same place where we're setting the acceleration, that is, in Ship.activityDefnDoSpaceshipStuffBuild().  Nice!


7. Letting the User Control the Ship
---------------------------------

7.1. It'd be even nicer if we could steer the ship.  Going where the driver wants to go is a major component of consumer satisfication with any vehicle.

7.2. To do that, we need to add some Actions that the ship can perform in order to accelerate up, down, left, or right, and then we need to associate, or "map", those Actions to keyboard inputs using some ActionToInputsMapping instances.

7.3. The Actions we need happen to already be defined as part of the Movable class, so they and their corresponding mappings just need to be registered in the PlaceDefault class.  Open PlaceDefault.ts, locate the existing declaration of the "actions" variable, and add the following elements to the array, adding commas as necessary:

	Movable.actionAccelerateDown(),
	Movable.actionAccelerateLeft(),
	Movable.actionAccelerateRight(),
	Movable.actionAccelerateUp()

7.4. Still in PlaceDefault.ts, locate the existing declaration of the "actionToInputsMappings" array, and add these items, adjusting commas as necessary:

	ActionToInputsMapping.fromActionNameAndInputName
	(
		Movable.actionAccelerateDown().name,
		inputNames.ArrowDown
	),
	ActionToInputsMapping.fromActionNameAndInputName
	(
		Movable.actionAccelerateLeft().name,
		inputNames.ArrowLeft
	),
	ActionToInputsMapping.fromActionNameAndInputName
	(
		Movable.actionAccelerateRight().name,
		inputNames.ArrowRight
	),
	ActionToInputsMapping.fromActionNameAndInputName
	(
		Movable.actionAccelerateUp().name,
		inputNames.ArrowUp
	)

7.4. This code defines the Actions and the input mappings for them, but in order to actually use them, we'll need to give the Ship entity the Movable property.  We also need to change its Actor property's activity so that it listens to the user's input rather than mindlessly shuttling back and forth forever.

7.5. Open Ship.ts and replace the existing declaration of the Actor property with the following text, adjusting commas as necessary:

	Actor.fromActivityDefnName
	(
		UserInputListener.activityDefn().name
	)

7.6. Still in Ship.ts, add the following to the list of properties just modified, adjusting commas as necessary:

	Movable.fromAccelerationAndSpeedMax(0.2, 2)

7.7. Also, now that we're not using the "DoSpaceshipStuff" ActivityDefn, we can remove the declaration of the static Ship.activityDefnDoSpaceshipStuffBuild() method entirely.  (I know we just added it, but less code is always better!  Technically, for quality's sake we should've quit before we started.)

7.8. Because we removed the declaration of the "DoSpaceshipStuff" ActivityDefn, we'll also need to remove the reference to it.  Open WorldGame.ts and, in the static .defnBuild() method, remove the line "Ship.activityDefnDoSpaceshipStuffBuild()" from the ActivityDefns being passed to the WorldDefn constructor call.

7.9. Now that the Ship entity is listening for user input, we no longer need that instance of UserInputListener() that came built-in to the stub code.  Two entities listening and reacting to the same input might get weird.  Open PlaceDefault.ts again and, in the constructor, remove the line "new UserInputListener()" from the list of entities being passed to the super() call.

7.10. Run the _Build script and refresh the web browser.  Use the arrow keys to cause the spaceship to acelerate up, down, left, and right.  You're a driver, you're a winner.

8. Adding an Ally and an Enemy
------------------------------

8.1. Driving around aimlessly is fun for a while, but conflict is the essence of drama.  It's time to add a villain and a victim, so that you can be the rescuer.

8.2. First, we'll create the victim, which we'll call a Habitat.  In the Model directory, add a new file named "Habitat.ts", containing the following text:

	class Habitat extends Entity
	{
		constructor(pos: Coords)
		{
			super
			(
				Habitat.name,
				[
					Constrainable.create(),

					Drawable.fromVisual
					(
						VisualPolygon.fromVerticesAndColorFill
						(
							[
								Coords.fromXY(4, 0),
								Coords.fromXY(-4, 0),
								Coords.fromXY(-4, -4),
								Coords.fromXY(0, -8),
								Coords.fromXY(4, -4)
							],
							Color.Instances().Brown
						)
					),

					Locatable.fromPos(pos)
				]
			);
		}
	}

8.3. Next, we'll create the villain, which we'll call a "Raider".  Still in the Model directory, create a new file named Raider.ts, containing the following text.  This class is quite a bit more complex than the previous one, since the raider has to actually move around and kidnap people and stuff, while all the Habitat has to do is sit there looking vulnerable.

	class Raider extends Entity
	{
		habitatCaptured: Habitat;

		_displacement: Coords;

		constructor(pos: Coords)
		{
			super
			(
				Raider.name,
				[
					Actor.fromActivityDefnName
					(
						Raider.activityDefnBuild().name
					),

					Constrainable.fromConstraint
					(
						new Constraint_WrapToPlaceSizeX()
					),

					Drawable.fromVisual
					(
						VisualGroup.fromChildren
						(
							VisualEllipse.fromSemiaxesAndColorFill
							(
								6, 4, Color.Instances().Green
							),
							VisualEllipse.fromSemiaxesAndColorFill
							(
								4, 3, Color.Instances().Red
							),
							VisualFan.fromRadiusAnglesStartAndSpannedAndColorsFillAndBorder
							(
								4, // radius
								.5, .5, // angleStart-, angleSpannedInTurns
								Color.Instances().Red, null // colorFill, colorBorder
							)
						)
					),

					Locatable.fromPos(pos),

					Movable.fromAccelerationAndSpeedMax(2, 1)
				]
			);

			this._displacement = Coords.create();
		}

		static activityDefnBuild(): ActivityDefn
		{
			return new ActivityDefn
			(
				Raider.name, Raider.activityDefnPerform
			);
		}

		static activityDefnPerform(uwpe: UniverseWorldPlaceEntities): void
		{
			var universe = uwpe.universe;
			var place = uwpe.place;
			var entity = uwpe.entity;

			var raider = entity as Raider;

			var raiderPos = raider.locatable().loc.pos;

			var raiderActor = raider.actor();
			var raiderActivity = raiderActor.activity;
			var targetEntity = raiderActivity.targetEntity();

			if (targetEntity == null)
			{
				var placeDefault = place as PlaceDefault;
				var habitats = placeDefault.habitats();
				if (habitats.length == 0)
				{
					return; // todo
				}
				else
				{
					targetEntity = ArrayHelper.random
					(
						habitats, universe.randomizer
					);
					raiderActivity.targetEntitySet(targetEntity);
				}
			}

			var targetPos = targetEntity.locatable().loc.pos;
			var displacementToTarget = raider._displacement.overwriteWith
			(
				targetPos
			).subtract
			(
				raiderPos
			);
			var distanceToTarget = displacementToTarget.magnitude();
			var raiderMovable = raider.movable();
			if (distanceToTarget >= raiderMovable.accelerationPerTick)
			{
				var displacementToMove = displacementToTarget.divideScalar
				(
					distanceToTarget
				).multiplyScalar
				(
					raiderMovable.speedMax
				);
				raiderPos.add(displacementToMove);
			}
			else
			{
				raiderPos.overwriteWith(targetPos);
				if (raider.habitatCaptured == null)
				{
					raider.habitatCaptured = targetEntity;

					var targetConstrainable = targetEntity.constrainable();

					var constraintToAddToTarget = new Constraint_Multiple
					([
						new Constraint_AttachToEntityWithId(raider.id),
						new Constraint_Transform
						(
							new Transform_Translate(Coords.fromXY(0, 10) )
						)
					]);

					targetConstrainable.constraintAdd(constraintToAddToTarget);

					targetEntity = new Entity
					(
						"EscapePoint",
						[
							Locatable.fromPos
							(
								raiderPos.clone().addXY
								(
									0, 0 - place.size.y
								)
							)
						]
					);
					raiderActivity.targetEntitySet(targetEntity);
				}
				else
				{
					place.entityToRemoveAdd(raider.habitatCaptured);
					place.entityToRemoveAdd(raider);
				}
			}
		}

	}

8.4. The Raider class uses the Actor property, and defines its very own ActivityDefn to use with it, so we need to register that ActivityDefn with the WorldDefn.  Open WorldGame.ts, locate the .defnBuild() method, and add the new activity definition in the proper place, adjusting commas as necessary:

	Raider.activityDefnBuild()

8.5. The Raider's activity makes use of the method PlaceDefault.habitats() to get a convenient array of all the Habitats on the level.  However, the sharp-eyed observer will note that that method doesn't exist yet.  So open PlaceDefault.ts and add the following lines just before the final close brace of the class:</p>

	habitats(): Habitat[]
	{
		return this._entities.filter
		(
			x => x.constructor.name == Habitat.name
		) as Habitat[];
	}

8.6. We also need to add references to the newly declared Habitat and Raider classes in Game.html.  These should be added near the ones previously added for Planet and Ship:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="Model/Habitat.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="Model/Raider.js"></script>

8.7. Now we'll add one habitat and one raider to the level.  Open PlaceDefault.ts, and, in the constructor, add these two lines to bottom of the array of Entities being passed to the super() call.  Make sure to separate all the array elements with commas as appropriate:

	new Habitat(Coords.fromXY(150, 250) ),
	new Raider(Coords.fromXY(200, -50) )

8.8. Finally, run the build script and refresh the web browser.  Now a civilian habitat appears on the ground.  An alien raider will descend from the top of the screen, pick up the habitat, carry it back up to the top of the screen, and disappear forever.  Tragic!

<img src="Screenshot-8-Raider_Takes_Habitat.gif" />


9. Adding Weapons
-----------------

9.1. Right now, there's nothing you can do about aliens kidnapping your people, because your ship has no weapons.  You just have to sit and watch as the people you swore to protect are abducted by aliens with clearly nefarious intent.  How does it feel?  Feels bad, right?  

So let's give this kitten some claws.  (The kitten is your spaceship.  The claws are, like, plasma blasters.)

9.2. To give your spaceship the ability to fire bullets, open Ship.ts and add these lines to the list of entity properties in the constructor, remembering to adjust commas to separate array elements:

	ProjectileGenerator.fromNameAndGenerations
	(
		"Bullet",
		[
			ProjectileGeneration.fromRadiusDistanceSpeedTicksDamageAndVisual
			(
				2, // radius
				5, // distanceInitial
				4, // speed
				128, // ticksToLive
				Damage.fromAmount(1),
				VisualGroup.fromChildren
				([
					VisualSound.default(),

					VisualCircle.fromRadiusAndColorFill
					(
						2, Color.Instances().Yellow
					)
				])
			)
		]
	)

9.3. Now your ship has a gun, but no trigger.  That is to say, it could technically generate bullets, only there's no ActionToInputsMapping to detect when you want to fire them, and even if there were, there's no Action to map that mapping to.  To add the Action and its mapping, open PlaceDefault.ts and, in the .defnBuild() method, add this line to the end of the "actions" array:

	ProjectileGenerator.actionFire()

9.4. And these lines to the end of "actionsToInputMappings" array:

	ActionToInputsMapping.fromActionNameAndInputName
	(
		ProjectileGenerator.actionFire().name,
		inputNames.Space
	)

(As always, remember to delimit these new array elements from the existing ones with commas.)

9.7. Re-run the build script and refresh the web browser.  The good news is, your spaceship will now shoot bullets when you press the spacebar!

<img src="Screenshot-9-Spaceship_Fires_Bullet.gif" />


10. Making Weapons Work
-----------------------

10.1. The bad news is, those bullets don't do anything yet.  Even if you manage to hit the raider with them, they'll just pass harmlessly through it, because right now it's pretty much immortal.  It's too dumb to die!

10.2. So let's make it mortal.  Open Raider.ts and add the following lines to the array of entity properties being declared in the constructor.  You could add them at the end of the array, or make things a bit neater and add them in alphabetical order.  Whichever you choose, be sure to add commas in the proper places.

	Collidable.fromCollider(Sphere.fromRadius(4) ),

	Killable.fromIntegrityMax(1),

These lines make the raider collidable, which means that your bullets can hit it, and killable, which means that when you bullets hit it they can hurt it.

10.3. However, in order for Collidables and Killables to be processed correctly, they'll need to be added to the list of property types that PlaceDefault understands.  Open PlaceDefault.ts and replace the existing declaration of the entityPropertyNamesToProcess array with the following:

	var entityPropertyNamesToProcess =
	[
		Locatable.name,
		Constrainable.name,
		Collidable.name,
		Actor.name,
		Ephemeral.name,
		Killable.name
	];

10.4 Re-compile the game and refresh the web browser.  Now your bullets can destroy the Raider, which is good, because otherwise what's the point of bullets, man?

<img src="Screenshot-10-Bullet_Destroys_Raider.gif" />


11. Giving the Ground Some Weight
---------------------------------

11.1. You can now save the habitat, and, by extension, the day.  However, there's still a few problems to fix.

First of all, when your ship flies into the ground, nothing happens.  When you fly real spaceships into the ground, they explode.  Just ask NASA.  Actually, you could probably ask anyone.

Second, when you destroy the raider after it picks up the Habitat and lifts it into the air, the habitat, being a massive object in a planetary gravity field, should fall back to the ground.  And actually, it does fall!  Just not on purpose, and not because of gravity.  And it then falls right through the ground and keeps falling forever, which really hurts the fidelity of the simulation.

11.2. Before we fix the problem of the habitat not falling when it should, we have to fix the problem of the habitat falling when it shouldn't.  It's falling because of the constraint that the raider set on it when it picked it up isn't cleared when the raider is destroyed.  That constraint basically moves the habitat to wherever the raider is and then moves it a little bit down from there.  Now that the raider's been destroyed, the habitat can't copy the raider's position like before, and so it just keeps moving it down from wherever it currently is.

To fix it, we need to modify the Killable property on the Raider entity so that it clears the constraint it added on the habitat when it dies.

Open Raider.ts, locate the place in the constructor where the existing Killable property is being built, replace it with the following, and save:

	Killable.fromIntegrityMaxAndDie
	(
		1, // integrityMax
		(uwpe: UniverseWorldPlaceEntities) => // die
		{
			var raider = uwpe.entity;
			var habitatCaptured = raider.habitatCaptured;
			if (habitatCaptured != null)
			{
				var constraints =
					habitatCaptured.constrainable().constraints;
				constraints.length = constraints.length - 1;
			}
		}
	)

Now when you destroy the raider after it's picked up the habitat, the habitat will just float there eerily instead of falling.  This may not seem like progress, but it is, because now at least the habitat's not falling for the wrong reasons.

11.3. Now let's make the habitat fall for the right reasons.  To do that, we'll add more constraints on it.  One constraint will make it subject to gravity, and another will keep it from passing through the planet surface like a ghost.

Open Habitat.ts, then, in the constructor, locate where the existing Constrainable is being created, and replace it with the following:

	Constrainable.fromConstraints
	([
		new Constraint_Gravity(Coords.fromXY(0, .03)),
		new Constraint_ContainInHemispace
		(
			new Hemispace
			(
				new Plane(new Coords(0, 1, 0), 250)
			)
		)
	]),

(Now, "hemispace" is a fancy word, but it just means that half of all space that lies on one side of a given plane.  In this case, the plane in question is the ground, and we're constraining the habitat so that it can only occupy the half of space that lies above the plane of the ground, that is, the sky.  Actually, technically we're constraining it so that it can only occupy the half of space below a plane whose normal points downward into the ground, but that's semantics.)

Every tick, the first new constraint will accelerate the habitat downward, and the second will prevent it from tunnelling into the surface of the planet.

11.4. Your spaceship should also not tunnel into the surface of the planet, at least not without consequences.  For now, open Ship.ts, locate the existing Constrainable in its constructor, and replace it with the following:

	Constrainable.fromConstraints
	([
		new Constraint_WrapToPlaceSizeXTrimY(),
		new Constraint_ContainInHemispace
		(
			new Hemispace
			(
				new Plane(new Coords(0, 1, 0), 250)
			)
		)
	]),

The new constraint is exactly the same as the one for the habitat.

11.5. Since the new code makes use of the previously unreferenced classes Constraint_ContainInHemispace, Constraint_Gravity, and Hemispace, we'll need to add those references to the Imports.ts file:

	import Constraint_ContainInHemispace = gf.Constraint_ContainInHemispace;
	import Constraint_Gravity = gf.Constraint_Gravity;
	import Hemispace = gf.Hemispace;

And also to the Game.html file:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="Framework/Source/Geometry/Constraints/Constraint_ContainInHemispace.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="Framework/Source/Geometry/Constraints/Constraint_Gravity.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="Framework/Source/Geometry/Shapes/Hemispace.js"></script>

11.6. Recompile and restart the game.  Let the raider grab the habitat and carry it up a short distance, then shoot the raider.  The habitat will slowly fall back to the planet surface.  Also, you shouldn't be able to fly your ship below the surface of the planet, although you can still smack into it as fast as you want with no consequences.  One thing at a time.


12. Adding Win and Lose Conditions
----------------------------------

12.1. The program we've written so far is closer to being a real game than ever, but it still lacks some things.  For one thing, there's no way to lose, which might appeal to certain people.  But then again, there's no way to win, other than whatever feeling of satisfaction you can derive from a single habitat not being destroyed by alien raiders.  But, having growing up in our modern go-go culture, most players would prefer more external validation.

So let's add some.  We'll add some code that checks each tick to see if there are no more raiders, in which case the player wins, or if there are no more habitats, in which case, the player loses.  In either case, a message will be displayed that explains what just happened, and the game will return to the title screen.

Open Ship.ts, and, in the constructor, at the end of the list of properties, insert the text below (remembering to add a comma at the end of the preceding property declaration) and save:

	new Triggerable
	([
		new Trigger
		(
			"Lose",
			(uwpe: UniverseWorldPlaceEntities) => // isTriggered
			{
				var level = uwpe.place as PlaceDefault;
				var areAllTheHabitatsGone = (level.habitats().length == 0);
				return areAllTheHabitatsGone;
			}, 
			(uwpe: UniverseWorldPlaceEntities) => // reactToBeingTriggered
			{
				uwpe.universe.venueNext = VenueMessage.fromMessageAndAcknowledge
				(
					DataBinding.fromContext("You lose!"),
					() => // acknowledge
					{
						universe.venueNext = universe.controlBuilder.title
						(
							universe, universe.display.sizeInPixels,
						).toVenue();
					}
				)
			}
		),

		new Trigger
		(
			"Win",
			(uwpe: UniverseWorldPlaceEntities) => // isTriggered
			{
				var level = uwpe.place as PlaceDefault;
				var areAllTheRaidersGone = (level.raiders().length == 0);
				return areAllTheRaidersGone;
			}, 
			(uwpe: UniverseWorldPlaceEntities) => // reactToBeingTriggered
			{
				var universe = uwpe.universe;
				universe.venueNext = VenueMessage.fromMessageAndAcknowledge
				(
					DataBinding.fromContext("You win!"),
					() => // acknowledge
					{
						universe.venueNext = universe.controlBuilder.title
						(
							universe, universe.display.sizeInPixels,
						).toVenue();
					}
				)
			}
		)
	])

12.2. Since the new code uses the previously unreferenced classes Trigger and Triggerable, it will be necessary to add them to Imports.ts:

	import Trigger = gf.Trigger;
	import Triggerable = gf.Triggerable;

And also to Game.html:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="Framework/Source/Model/Trigger.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="Framework/Source/Model/Triggerable.js"></script>

12.3. It will also be necessary to add Triggerable to the list of entity properties that the PlaceDefault class handles.  Open PlaceDefault.ts, locate the existing entityPropertyNamesToProcess declaration, and replace it with the following:

	var entityPropertyNamesToProcess =
	[
		Locatable.name,
		Constrainable.name,
		Collidable.name,
		Actor.name,
		Ephemeral.name,
		Killable.name,
		Triggerable.name
	];

Also, you'll need to add this method at the end of the PlaceDefault class, right below the existing .habitats() method, so that it can tell how many raiders are left:

	raiders(): Raider[]
	{
		return this.entities.filter(x => x.constructor.name == Raider.name) as Raider[];
	}

12.4. Save the changes, recompile, and restart.  Now, when you blow up the raider, or when the raider takes the habitat off the top of the screen, you'll see either a win or lose message.  When you click the button to dismiss the message dialog, the game will end and return to the title screen.


13. Conclusion
--------------

13.1. Well, it's technically a game at this point, albeit not much of one.  Here's some future features that might make the game more fun:

* Add appropriate visual and sound effects when things happen.
* Destroy the player's ship when it runs into a raider.
* Give the player multiple lives.
* Let the raiders shoot bullets.
* Add more habitats to protect.
* Require the player to catch a habitat as it falls, or else it explodes on impact.
* Generate more raiders, on a timer.
* Make the planet bigger than a single screen and implement scrolling.
* Add a minimap to show the parts of the planet that are not currently on screen.
* Add some on-screen controls to show how many raiders, habitats, bullets, and lives are left.
* Transition to a new and harder level when the player wins the current level.
* Make ammuntion limited and add reloading by picking up bullets.
* Make the surface of the planet a little less boring to look at.

The framework contains features to support all these features, though it might not be easy to figure out how.  To be continued!
