echo to transpile the game from TypeScript to JavaScript.

rem %tab% seems to now be sending the control sequence "\t"
rem rather than an actual tab, so the formatting has been removed for now.

rem The parsing in the next line is because
rem leading zeroes are disallowed in TypeScript,
rem because they're interpreted as octals, which are deprecated!
rem Also, parsing may fail if the date formatting has been changed from the default.

rem I don't remember why this next line had to change, then change back.
rem Perhaps different versions of Windows
rem format the string returned by the "date" and "time" command differently?

rem echo static buildTime(): Date { return new Date(%date:~10,4%, (parseInt("%date:~4,2%") - 1), parseInt("%date:~7,2%"), parseInt("%time:~0,2%"), parseInt("%time:~3,2%"), parseInt("%time:~6,2%")); } >> _BuildRecord.ts
