Game Framework
==============

The TypeScript code in this repository implements a video game framework and demonstrates its features with a simple video game.

Running
-------

To run, open the file GameFramework.html in a web browser that runs JavaScript.  Because the latest compiled .js files are included as part of the repository, it should not be necessary to build the game first before it can be run.


Building
--------

* Install Node.js.
* Install the Typescript compiler TSC with the command "npm install tsc".
* Run the command "tsc" within the "Source" directory.


Features
--------

* Display - System-level graphics concepts are abstracted behind interfaces.
* Controls - Buttons, lists, text boxes, scrollbars, tabs, and so on.
* Persistence - Player profiles and saving and loading games to and from browser local storage or files.
* Media - Loading and presenting images, sounds, music, videos, fonts, text, and data files.
* Physics - Position, orientation, movement, and collision detection and response.
* Model - Common game concepts like inventory, equipment, crafting, conversations, skills, containers, and trade.
