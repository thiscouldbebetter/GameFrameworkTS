Known Issues
============

At startup, on the "loading" screen, an "Acknowledge" button is visible, but should not be, as no user input is sought.

In the starting room, the walls are not at the edges.  Maybe a camera constraint problem?

In the starting room, when picking up the "SwordCold", it does not disappear from the environment as it should.

On the "Equip" tab, the SwordCold does not appear in the list of equippable items.  It can only be equipped by going to the "Items" tab, selecting it, and clicking the "Use" button.

On the "Items" tab, it's possible that the "Use" button only fires when clicked by the mouse, not when selected and the Enter key pressed.

When the SwordCold is equipped, it sometimes appears to be held by the midpoint rather than the hilt.

The "Friendly" can walk past the edges of the starting room, flicker, and escape.
